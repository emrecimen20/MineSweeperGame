# Minesweeper Game

## About the Game

Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game where players attempt to uncover mines hidden on a game board. Players click on square tiles on the board to reveal non-mine tiles. If a mine is clicked, the game ends.

## How to Play

- The game begins with a game board consisting of square tiles of certain dimensions.
- Each square tile on the board either contains a mine or is empty. The objective for the player is to uncover all non-mine tiles to complete the game.
- When a player clicks on a tile, if there is a mine underneath, the player loses the game. Otherwise, the tile is revealed, and a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to it is displayed.
- To win the game, the player must uncover all non-mine tiles.
